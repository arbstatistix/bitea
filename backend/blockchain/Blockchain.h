/*******************************************************************************
 * BLOCKCHAIN.H - Distributed Ledger Chain Management
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This header defines the Blockchain class, which manages a chain of linked
 * blocks forming an immutable, tamper-evident distributed ledger. It handles
 * block creation, mining, validation, and transaction management.
 * 
 * BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE:
 * The blockchain is a data structure consisting of:
 * 1. Chain: Ordered sequence of blocks linked via cryptographic hashes
 * 2. Pending Transactions: Pool of unconfirmed transactions awaiting mining
 * 3. Consensus Rules: Mining difficulty and block size limits
 * 
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * - IMMUTABILITY: Once added, blocks cannot be changed without detection
 * - CHAIN INTEGRITY: Each block references previous block's hash
 * - PROOF-OF-WORK: Mining provides computational proof of block validity
 * - DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS: All nodes can independently verify chain validity
 * 
 * INTEGRATION WITH OTHER COMPONENTS:
 * - Block.h: Individual block implementation with mining capabilities
 * - Transaction.h: Data entries (posts, likes) stored in blocks
 * - HttpServer.h (main.cpp): Exposes blockchain via REST API
 * - Database (MongoClient): Persistent storage of blockchain state
 * 
 * REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
 * Think of blockchain as a ledger book where:
 * - Each page (block) contains transactions
 * - Pages are numbered sequentially (index)
 * - Each page references previous page's fingerprint (hash)
 * - Pages are sealed with a difficult puzzle (Proof-of-Work)
 * - Tearing out or altering pages is immediately detectable
 * 
 * APPLICATIONS IN BITEA:
 * - Social media posts stored immutably
 * - Like/unlike actions recorded transparently
 * - User registrations tracked chronologically
 * - Content authenticity verified cryptographically
 * 
 * SECURITY MODEL:
 * - Cryptographic linking prevents historical tampering
 * - Proof-of-Work makes forgery computationally expensive
 * - Public verifiability enables trustless validation
 * - No central authority needed for data integrity

/**
 * @class Blockchain
 * @brief Manages the chain of blocks forming the distributed ledger
 * 
 * DESIGN PATTERN: Singleton-like behavior (typically one instance per application)
 * 
 * RESPONSIBILITIES:
 * 1. Chain Management: Add blocks, validate chain integrity
 * 2. Transaction Pool: Collect pending transactions for mining
 * 3. Mining Coordination: Trigger block mining when conditions met
 * 4. Consensus Enforcement: Ensure all blocks follow difficulty rules
 * 5. Thread Safety: Protect against concurrent modifications
 * 
 * DATA STRUCTURE:
 * - Vector of shared_ptr<Block>: Maintains chronological chain
 * - Vector of Transactions: Temporary storage before mining
 * 
 * LIFECYCLE:
 * 1. Construction: Create genesis block (first block, index 0)
 * 2. Operation: Accept transactions, mine blocks periodically
 * 3. Validation: Continuously verify chain integrity
 * 
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * Uses std::mutex to serialize access to chain and pending transactions
 * Multiple threads can safely add transactions and mine blocks

     * @brief The ordered sequence of blocks forming the blockchain

     * 
     * PURPOSE: Stores the complete history of all mined blocks
     * 
     * WHY std::vector:
     * - Dynamic sizing (grows as new blocks are added)
     * - Fast indexed access: O(1) to access any block by index
     * - Contiguous memory for cache efficiency
     * - Standard library support (iterators, algorithms)
     * 
     * WHY std::shared_ptr:
     * - Automatic memory management (no manual delete needed)
     * - Shared ownership (multiple references to same block possible)
     * - Exception safety (prevents memory leaks)
     * - nullptr safety (can check validity)
     * 
     * ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED: std::unique_ptr
     * Shared_ptr chosen because blocks may be referenced by:
     * - The chain vector
     * - API responses being prepared
     * - Database serialization threads
     * 
     * CHAIN INVARIANT:
     * - chain[0] is always the genesis block
     * - chain[i].previousHash == chain[i-1].hash (for i > 0)
     * - chain.size() >= 1 (always has genesis block)
     * 
     * GROWTH PATTERN:
     * Starts with 1 block (genesis), grows unbounded
     * Production systems might implement pruning or archival

     * - Need ability to take arbitrary number of transactions (batch)
     * - May implement priority ordering in future (high fees first)
     * - Erase range operation useful for removing mined transactions
     * 
     * CONCURRENCY:
     * Protected by chainMutex to prevent race conditions
     * Multiple threads may call addTransaction() simultaneously

     * 
     * LOCKING STRATEGY:
     * - Coarse-grained locking (one mutex for entire blockchain)
     * - Simple but may create contention under high load
     * - Could be optimized with reader-writer locks or finer-grained locking
     *

     * - Prevents blocks from growing too large

     * - Regular block creation for timely transaction confirmation

     * - Development/Testing: 10 (fast block creation)
     * - Production: 100-1000 (balance between throughput and latency)
     * - Bitcoin: ~2000-3000 transactions per block (varies with tx size)
     * 
     * DEFAULT: Set to 10 in constructor (configurable parameter)

     * RELATIONSHIP TO THROUGHPUT:
     * With maxTx=10 and 1 minute mining time:

     * 
     * Can be called as:

     * - Blockchain(6) â†’ Custom difficulty, default maxTx
     * - Blockchain(6, 20) â†’ Custom difficulty and maxTx
     * 
     * PARAMETER CHOICE GUIDE:
     * LOW DIFFICULTY (1-3):
     * - Fast mining (~milliseconds)
     * - Good for development/testing
     * - Low security (easy to attack)
     * 
     * MEDIUM DIFFICULTY (4-6):
     * - Moderate mining (~seconds)
     * - Good for demos and local testing
     * - Moderate security
     * 
     * HIGH DIFFICULTY (7+):
     * - Slow mining (~minutes to hours)

     * - Iterator range: [begin, begin+txCount)

     * - CPU-intensive operation (seconds to minutes depending on difficulty)
     * - Mutex held during mining (blocks other operations)
     * - Alternative: Release lock during mining (more complex)
     * 
     * CHAIN UPDATE:
     * chain.push_back(newBlock): Adds mined block to end of chain
     * - Atomic operation (vector guarantees strong exception safety)
     * - Chain grows sequentially (no gaps in indices)
     * 
     * CLEANUP:
     * pendingTransactions.erase(begin, begin+txCount): Removes mined transactions
     * - Erases range [begin, begin+txCount)
     * - Remaining transactions shift to front
     * - O(n) operation where n = remaining transactions

     * @brief Validates entire blockchain integrity
     * @return bool - true if chain is valid, false if corruption detected
     * 
     * PURPOSE: Ensures no blocks have been tampered with
     * 
     * VALIDATION CHECKS:
     * For each block (starting from index 1, skipping genesis):
     * 1. Block has valid Proof-of-Work (hash starts with required zeros)
     * 2. Block's stored hash matches recalculated hash (data not tampered)
     * 3. Block's previousHash matches previous block's hash (chain link intact)
     * 
     * ALGORITHM:
     * - Iterate from index 1 to end (genesis block unchecked - hard-coded)
     * - For each block, validate using Block::isValid()
     * - Verify chain link: currentBlock.previousHash == previousBlock.hash
     * - Return false immediately if any check fails
     * - Return true if all blocks pass
     * 
     * WHY START AT INDEX 1:
     * Genesis block (index 0) has no previous block, so skip it
     * Genesis block is hard-coded and trusted by definition
     * 
     * DETECTING ATTACKS:
     * SCENARIO 1: Attacker modifies transaction in block 5
     * - Block 5 hash changes (due to SHA-256 avalanche effect)
     * - Block 5 isValid() fails (stored hash â‰  recalculated hash)
     * - Detected!
     * 
     * SCENARIO 2: Attacker modifies block 5 and recalculates its hash
     * - Block 5 hash now correct, but different from original
     * - Block 6 previousHash still points to old block 5 hash
     * - Chain link broken: Block 6 previousHash â‰  Block 5 new hash
     * - Detected!
     * 
     * SCENARIO 3: Attacker modifies block 5 and re-mines blocks 5,6,7...
     * - Requires enormous computational power (re-mine all subsequent blocks)
     * - This is the "51% attack" (need majority of network hash power)
     * - Prevented by Proof-of-Work difficulty
     * 
     * EFFICIENCY: O(n*m) where n = blocks, m = avg transactions per block
     * Each isValid() call recalculates hash, which processes all transactions
     * 
     * WHY const:
     * Read-only validation, doesn't modify blockchain state
     * 
     * USAGE:
     * - API endpoint: GET /api/blockchain/validate
     * - System health checks
     * - After receiving blockchain from network
     * - Periodic integrity audits

/*******************************************************************************
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
 * - Single-threaded mining: Simplifies implementation, holds lock during mining
 * - Auto-mining: Blocks created automatically when pending pool fills
 * - Fixed difficulty: All blocks use same difficulty (could be adaptive)
 * - No pruning: Chain grows unbounded (production might implement pruning)
 * 
 * MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
 * - shared_ptr for blocks: Enables safe sharing with API handlers
 * - Vectors manage memory automatically
 * - No manual new/delete needed
 * 
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 * - Coarse-grained locking: One mutex for entire blockchain
 * - Simple but may cause contention under high load
 * - Alternative: Reader-writer locks, finer-grained locking
 * 
 * SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Validation is O(n*m): Expensive for large chains
 * - Could cache validation results
 * - Consider incremental validation (only new blocks)
 * - Implement checkpointing for long chains
 * 
 * SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Proof-of-Work prevents easy forgery
 * - Chain validation detects tampering
 * - No network layer (single-node implementation)
 * - No consensus mechanism (would need for distributed system)
 * 
 * POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:
 * - Merkle tree for efficient transaction verification
 * - Adaptive difficulty adjustment
 * - Transaction priority queue (fee-based)
 * - Parallel mining (release lock during mining)
 * - Network layer for distributed consensus
 * - Database persistence (current: in-memory only)
 * - Chain pruning/archival for old blocks
 * 
 * COMPARISON TO BITCOIN:
 * - Similar: Proof-of-Work, chain validation, transaction pool
 * - Different: No network, no UTXO model, simpler transaction types
 * - Purpose: Educational/demo vs. production cryptocurrency
 * 
 * TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
 * - Unit tests: Block creation, mining, validation
 * - Integration tests: Transaction flow, concurrent access
 * - Performance tests: Mining time vs. difficulty
 * - Security tests: Tampering detection, chain validation
